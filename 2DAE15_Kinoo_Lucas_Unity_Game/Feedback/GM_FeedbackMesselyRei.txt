Mechanics:
Game feels to basic and too easy. I finished first try, without dying.
Vision of the enemy is unclear and whenever you go through a hedge and he doesn't see it, his updated pathing is too abrupt.
I would expect he investigates where he saw me last, see I am not there anymore and carry on with patrolling.
I assume the other static time that is present is some sort of time you want to be under, I finished in aprox 20 secs. Depending on what you want to do
with your game, this time should be significantly lower, or challenge should be imposed in other ways.

After testing a few times, it's entirely possible to encounter your enemy and having almost no time to react, or not encountering him at all.

Player Feedback: 
There is none. I would like some kind of alert effect, being it sound or some kind of exclamation mark solid snake style.
I would like a vision cone for the enemy.

Learning Curve:
I don't think there is any besides learning the maze, but that can be bruteforced easily.

I would introduce a learning curve through either skilled timing of movement or deception (throwing stuff to distract enemy for example)
