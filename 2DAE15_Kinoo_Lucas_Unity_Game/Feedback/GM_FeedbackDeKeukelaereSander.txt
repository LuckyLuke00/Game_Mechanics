Mechanics:
The game currently feels very easy and there is not really a threat by the enemies. After playing the game 3 times I encountered an enemy once. 
I would probably add more enemies without it being too crowded. A bit of trial and error.
Maybe I would also add something to know in advance if there's an enemy close. Because currently I ran through the level without any caution.

Player Feedback: 
No player feedback yet.
I would add indicators if enemies are close or if they have seen you. Because then you know you have to run.
I would also add a mesh that shows what an enemy can see, so you can know if you're gonna be spotted when you run past the enemy.

Learning Curve:
Only one level so there is no learning curve yet.
Possible ways of a learning curve is levels with less hedges you can hide behind.
Stationary enemies vs Patrolling enemies
More enemies with harder levels
