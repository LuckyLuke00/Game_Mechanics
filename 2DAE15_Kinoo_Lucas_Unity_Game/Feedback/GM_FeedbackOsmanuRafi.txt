mechanics: - Mechanics are easy to grasp. 
	   - The Enemy Searching for you works very well and its fun to shake him off	
           - In a future stage the obvious change would be more levels and maybe more enemies to make it harder

player feedback: 

		- There is some player feedback like the timer
		- Maybe add an effect when the enemy notices you so that it is clear for the player that he needs to run
